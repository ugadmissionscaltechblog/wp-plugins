== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Molongui Authorship work with my theme? =

Yes. Molongui Authorship is compatible with any theme. You may face some issues though, like the author box not having a style you configured or the author pages not listing co-authored posts. In such cases, you can [open a support ticket](https://www.molongui.com/help/support/) with us and we will look into it to find a compatibility fix.

= Can I use Molongui Authorship with Elementor, Divi and other page builders? =

Yes.

= Where is the author box displayed? =

By default, the author box is added at the bottom of all your posts. However, Molongui Authorship provides you plenty of display options to change that. You can change the location to make it display at the top of the post content, hide it on some posts or disable the automatic display so you can decide on which handpicked posts it must be shown. The [Pro](https://www.molongui.com/wordpress-plugin-post-authors) version of the plugin allows you to hide the author box based on the post category.

= Can I display the author box on a page? =

Yes. Unlike other author box plugins, Molongui Authorship allows you to show the author box on both posts and pages. To be able to display the author box on pages, go to **Authors > Settings > Author Box** and find the **Display** panel. There you can configure Molongui Authorship to automatically display the author box on pages.

= Can I use Molongui Authorship on custom post types? =

Yes. You need the [Pro version](https://www.molongui.com/wordpress-plugin-post-authors "Molongui Authorship Pro") of the plugin to enjoy the features on custom post types.

= I have two author boxes. How can I hide one? =

The second author box might be a theme feature and you will need to turn it off from your theme's options screen, or hide it with custom CSS. Please refer to [this support article](https://www.molongui.com/help/the-author-box-shows-up-twice/) to know how to proceed. If that doesn't help, you can [open a support ticket](https://www.molongui.com/help/support/) with us so we can assist.

= Where are all the available social networks? I can't see them all... =

To avoid clutter the edit screen, some social networks are not displayed by default. To configure which networks to display, go to **Authors > Settings > More** and find the **Social Networks** panel. There you can pick the ones you need.

= Why some social media profiles are premium options? =

Those social media networks which are intended for business and professional networking are only available in the [Pro version](https://www.molongui.com/wordpress-plugin-post-authors "Molongui Authorship Pro") of the plugin.

= Where can I find documentation and user guides? =

For help setting up and configuring this plugin, please refer to our [documentation](https://www.molongui.com/help/authorship/).
